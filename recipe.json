In a chilled large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium speed, whip the remaining 1 1/3 cups cream until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate.

Using a clean pastry brush dipped in warm water, wash down the side of the pan to remove any sugar crystals. Raise the heat to medium-high and boil the syrup for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it registers 249\u00b0 F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, when the syrup reaches 235\u00b0 F, start preparing the egg yolks. In the 4 1/4-quart bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, using the wire whip attachment, beat the egg yolks for about 5 minutes, until thick, pale, and almost tripled in volume. When the syrup registers 249\u00b0 F, immediately remove it from the heat. While beating the egg yolks at medium speed, gradually pour the syrup in a slow, steady stream near the side of the bowl onto the yolks. Continue beating for 5-8 minutes, until the mixture is completely cool. If necessary, using a wire whisk, whisk the whip cream until, soft peaks form again. Using a large rubber spatula, fold a few tablespoons of the whipped cream into the ganache. Gradually fold in the remaining whipped cream, then gently fold in the cooled egg yolk mixture. Fold in the chopped candied mint. Scrape the parfait mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and freeze overnight. ( The parfait can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.) Combine the cocoa powder and chopped chocolate in a small bowl. Set aside. In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves.

(Alternatively, dough may be made in a standing electric mixer. In bowl of mixer make dough as described above. With dough hook knead dough about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.) Put dough in a very lightly oiled deep bowl, turning to coat, and let rise, covered loosely, in a warm place 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Punch down dough and divide into 4 equal pieces. Dough keeps, each piece put in a small, sealable plastic bag and sealed, pressing out excess air, chilled overnight or frozen 2 weeks. If dough is frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator before using. Makes enough dough for four 12- by 6-inch oval pizzas. Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. In a bowl toss squash with oil and salt and pepper to taste. Spread squash in one layer in a shallow baking pan and roast in middle of oven, stirring once halfway through roasting, 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove pan from oven and loosen squash with a metal spatula. Squash may be roasted 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. In a medium heavy saucepan stir together milk and flour and bring to a simmer over moderate heat, stirring constantly. Simmer sauce, stirring, 2 minutes and stir in nutmeg and salt to taste. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Increase temperature to 500\u00b0F. On a work surface sprinkled with 1 teaspoon cornmeal roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12- by 6-inch oval and transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cornmeal and dough, ending up with 2 ovals on each of 2 baking sheets. Spread sauce on dough ovals, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edge of each pizza, and sprinkle with Parmesan, squash, chopped sage, garlic, and pepper. Bake pizzas in lower and middle thirds of oven 15 minutes, or until crusts are crisp and pale golden. Garnish pizzas with sage sprigs.",

        "directions": "1. Prepare the turkey. Remove all extra parts; reserve giblets. Cut off wingtips and any excess neck, etc. Season turkey inside and out with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper; be generous. Loosen up leg joints without tearing skin. 2. Make the stuffing by roughly chopping the lemon , apple, onion, thyme, rosemary, sage, parsley and bay leaves into 1/2-inch pieces. Mix with oil. Put stuffing into cavity and truss the bird. Do not tie too tight. 3. Start the stock at least 30 minutes before roasting the turkey. Place the wingtips and neck in a saucepan; add 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam. Reduce heat to a slow simmer. Add onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves, peppercorns and parsley stems. Allow to simmer about 2 1/2 hours. Strain stock and reserve. You should have about 3 cups. 4. Make a paste by kneading 6 tablespoons unsalted butter with 1/4 cup flour. Rub this vigorously and thoroughly into the skin of the bird. 5. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons flour evenly on the bottom of a roasting pan. Place turkey on a rack in the pan. Allow time for turkey to come to room temperature if it is still cold to the touch. 6. Place turkey in oven. Leave in oven for 40 minutes or until the bird is browned all over. Combine 8 tablespoons butter with 1 teaspoon of water and bring to a boil. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and baste the turkey generously with the butter mixture. Repeat this process twice, once every 10 minutes, until basting liquid is used up. At this point, the turkey should be in the oven about 1 hour. Now baste 2 more times at intervals of 15 minutes, using pan drippings. At this point, the turkey has been in about 1 hour 30 minutes. Cook 20 minutes more without basting, to allow the skin to crisp. Remove from oven. Allow to rest at least 30 minutes before carving. Make the gravy during this resting period. 7. To make the gravy, remove turkey to a serving platter. Place roasting pan directly on top of a burner on medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing excess liquid to evaporate. Stir constantly. Now carefully remove any excess fat that has not combined with the flour to make a roux. Add the diced leek and cook for 1 minute. Slowly add 3 cups turkey stock, allowing the gravy to thicken as it comes to a boil. At this point it may be switched to a saucepan. Make sure that every bit of the pan drippings has been incorporated into the gravy. Add the giblets and simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir in the hard-boiled egg and remove from heat. Season to taste with freshly ground pepper and salt, if necessary. 8. Carve the turkey and pass the gravy. Serve with country sausage and sage dressing and cranberry relish.",
